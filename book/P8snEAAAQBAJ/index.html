It’s the invisible hand of our time. And it’s different from the useful friction of healthy conflict. That’s &lt;i&gt;good &lt;/i&gt;conflict, and it’s a necessary force that pushes us to be better people.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;High conflict, by contrast, is what happens when discord distills into a good-versus-evil kind of feud, the kind with an &lt;i&gt;us &lt;/i&gt;and a &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;. In this state, the normal rules of engagement no longer apply. The brain behaves differently. We feel increasingly certain of our own superiority and, at the same time, more and more mystified by the other side.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author and award-winning journalist Amanda Ripley investigates how good people get captured by high conflict—and how they break free.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our journey begins in California, where a world-renowned conflict expert struggles to extract himself from a political feud. Then we meet a Chicago gang leader who dedicates his life to a vendetta—only to find himself working beside the man who killed his childhood idol. Next, we travel to Colombia, to find out whether thousands of people can be nudged out of high conflict at scale. Finally, we return to America to see what happens when a group of liberal Manhattan Jews and conservative Michigan corrections officers choose to stay in each other’s homes in order to understand one another better.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;All these people, in dramatically different situations, were drawn into high conflict by similar forces, including conflict entrepreneurs, humiliation, and false binaries. But ultimately, all of them found ways to transform high conflict into something good, something that made them better people. They rehumanized and recatego­rized their opponents, and they revived curiosity and wonder, even as they &lt;i&gt;continued &lt;/i&gt;to fight for what they knew was right.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;People &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;escape high conflict. Individuals—even entire communities—can short-circuit the feedback loops of outrage and blame, if they want to. This is a mind-opening new way to think about conflict that will transform how we move through the world.</p><p class="text-sm my-4">Find out more at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=P8snEAAAQBAJ&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api" target="_blank" class="text-blue-400">http://books.google.com/books?id=P8snEAAAQBAJ&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api</a></p></div><div class="flex justify-between place-items-end mb-5 text-lg font-semibold"><a href="/bookoholic/" class="border-black border-2 px-8 py-1">Back</a><p class="bg-yellow-400 border-yellow-400 border-2 px-8 py-1"> Rating: 5★</p></div></div></div><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--></div><script type="module">import p from "/bookoholic/book/P8snEAAAQBAJ/_payload.js";window.__NUXT__={...p,...({state:{},_errors:{},serverRendered:true,config:{public:{},app:{baseURL:"\u002Fbookoholic\u002F",buildAssetsDir:"\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:""}},prerenderedAt:1674060963283})}</script><script type="module" src="/bookoholic/_nuxt/entry.e8288646.js" crossorigin></script><script type="module" src="/bookoholic/_nuxt/_...slug_.6a21ab7d.js" crossorigin></script></body>
